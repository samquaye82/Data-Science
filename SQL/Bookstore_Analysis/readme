For this project, I was required to create a program for a bookstore. The program should allow the clerk to enter data about new books into 
the database, update book information, delete books from the database and search to find the availability of books in the database.

I follow these steps:

I created a database called ebookstore and a table called books. The table has the following structure:

id Title Author Qty

The program presents the user with the following input menu: 

  1. Enter book 
  2. Update book 
  3. Delete book 
  4. Search books 
  0. Exit

And then executes each user prompted selection with the relevant functionality.

Using a python script to establish a connection to an sqlite database, I then utilise SQL queries to provide the functionality for the program.

The program successfully allows the clerk to:
  add new books to the database
  update book information
  delete books from the database
  search the database to find a specific book.
