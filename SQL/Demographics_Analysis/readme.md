# Customer Demographics Analysis 

## Problem

You have been given a CSV file that has transaction data for a retail store. You have been tasked with examining that data and coming back with some insights that are either immediately actionable or will lead to further exploration. 

## Actions

- Create and populate a database table in PostgreSQL via Python from the given csv file.
- Explore the dataset and assess what changes need to be made to make it good to use.
- Analyse the dataset using SQL queries to extract the information needed.

## Conclusions

These findings would be a good starting point to decide the overall business direction.
An interesting next step would be to try and understand the psychographic reasons behind these customers' buying decisions.
Combining this analysis with growth figures (not available in this dataset) would go a long way to identifying the most valuable customers to focus on.

## Next steps

Extract above average spending individual customers and build a demographic and pyschographic profile of them vs. rest of the dataset
